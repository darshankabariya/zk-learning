## Getting Started

### 📚 Learning Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Start with **[zk-fundamentals/START-HERE.md](./zk-fundamentals/START-HERE.md)** for a comprehensive introduction to ZK cryptography, proof systems (SNARKs, STARKs), and mathematical foundations.

**Topics covered:**
- ZK proof fundamentals
- Cryptographic primitives
- Proof systems comparison
- Research papers and researchers
- ZK applications (privacy, identity, etc.)

### 🚀 Understanding Ethereum Rollups
Explore **[rollups/ethereum-rollup-interactions.md](./rollups/ethereum-rollup-interactions.md)** to learn how Ethereum interacts with different rollup solutions.

**Topics covered:**
- Optimistic vs ZK Rollups
- Rollup architecture
- Ethereum L1/L2 interactions
- Data availability strategies
- Rollup comparisons (Arbitrum, zkSync, Optimism, StarkNet, etc.)

## Directory Details

### 🔐 [zk-fundamentals/](./zk-fundamentals/)
Deep dive into Zero-Knowledge Proof theory, cryptography, and proof systems. Includes structured learning materials, research references, and visual guides.

### 🌉 [rollups/](./rollups/)
Comprehensive guides on Ethereum Layer 2 rollup solutions, their architecture, and how they leverage ZK proofs for scaling.

### 📖 [docs/](./docs/)
Additional documentation, PDFs, and reference materials.

## Key Distinction

- **zk-fundamentals/** → Focus on ZK cryptography and proof theory
- **rollups/** → Focus on Ethereum scaling and rollup architecture

While ZK Rollups use zero-knowledge proofs, the rollups directory emphasizes their role in Ethereum scaling rather than the underlying cryptographic theory.
